# PM OS: Business Network + Catalogs (Retail/CPG)

A file-based PM operating system with daily workflow commands, senior PM skills, and automatic learning.

**Full implementation guide:** See `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`

---

## Quick Start

1. **Drop files** into `inputs/` folders (Jira tickets, VOC feedback)
2. **Run daily commands:** `/ktlo`, `/voc`, `/exec-update` (10-30 min)
3. **Review outputs** in `outputs/` directories

---

## Daily Commands

| Command | What It Does | Takes ~5-10 min |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| `/ktlo` | Triage KTLO backlog into prioritized buckets | inputs/jira/*.csv → outputs/ktlo/ |
| `/voc` | Synthesize VOC themes from customer feedback | inputs/voc/*.csv → outputs/insights/ |
| `/exec-update` | Generate 1-page stakeholder update | Latest outputs → outputs/exec_updates/ |

## Weekly Commands

| Command | What It Does | Takes ~15-20 min |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| `/charters` | Generate quarterly strategic charters | Truth base + VOC + KTLO → outputs/roadmap/ |

## Senior PM Commands

| Command | What It Does | Use When |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| `/stakeholders` | Map stakeholders using power/interest grid | Major initiative or cross-team project |
| `/gtm` | Create comprehensive GTM launch plan | Product/feature launch planning |
| `/strategy` | Write 3-5 year product strategy | Annual/bi-annual strategy planning |
| `/review` | Post-launch retrospective with lessons learned | 30/60/90 days after launch |

---

## All Available Skills

| Skill | Use When... | Inputs | Output |
|-------|-------------|--------|--------|
| `building-truth-base` | Starting on a product, need shared understanding | roadmap_deck, product_demo, knowledge_base | outputs/truth_base/ |
| `synthesizing-voc` | Have customer feedback, need themes | voc (min 3 sources) | outputs/insights/ |
| `triaging-ktlo` | Jira backlog needs productization | jira export | outputs/ktlo/ |
| `analyzing-kb-gaps` | Want user pain points via KB | knowledge_base, voc synthesis | outputs/insights/ |
| `generating-quarterly-charters` | Planning quarter, need strategic bets | truth base, voc, ktlo | outputs/roadmap/ |
| `writing-prds-from-charters` | Have charter, need executable PRD | charter | outputs/delivery/ |

## Folder Structure

### Inputs (drop your files here)
```
inputs/
├── roadmap_deck/     # Strategy slides, PDFs
├── voc/              # Customer feedback, transcripts, surveys
├── jira/             # Exported tickets (CSV preferred)
├── product_demo/     # Demo notes, walkthroughs
└── knowledge_base/   # KB article exports
```

### Outputs (skills write here)
```
outputs/
├── truth_base/       # Product understanding
├── insights/         # VOC synthesis, KB gaps
├── ktlo/             # KTLO triage reports
├── roadmap/          # Quarterly charters
├── delivery/         # PRDs
├── gtm/              # Go-to-market docs
└── exec_updates/     # Stakeholder updates
```

### History (versioned outputs)
```
history/
├── building-truth-base/
├── synthesizing-voc/
├── triaging-ktlo/
├── analyzing-kb-gaps/
├── generating-quarterly-charters/
└── writing-prds-from-charters/
```

### Alerts
```
alerts/
└── stale-outputs.md   # Tracks which outputs need refresh
```

---

## Memory & History

Every skill run:
1. Writes current output to `outputs/`
2. Copies dated version to `history/<skill>/`
3. Updates `alerts/stale-outputs.md`

**To check past work:**
- "What did I run last week?" → Claude reads history folders
- "Show me the previous VOC synthesis" → Claude finds dated files

---

## Staleness Tracking

Each output includes a metadata header tracking its sources:

```yaml
---
generated: 2025-01-15 14:30
skill: synthesizing-voc
sources:
  - inputs/voc/interview-1.md (modified: 2025-01-10)
downstream:
  - outputs/roadmap/Q1-charters.md
---
```

**How it works:**
1. When a source file is newer than an output, the output is "stale"
2. When a downstream output is newer than its sources, flag "drift" for review
3. Claude checks `alerts/stale-outputs.md` at session start
4. Claude reports: "These outputs may be stale: [list]"
5. Say "refresh <skill>" to regenerate

**Example:**
> "VOC synthesis may be stale - inputs/voc/interview-3.md was added after last synthesis. Refresh with `synthesizing-voc`?"

---

## Dependency Graph

```
TIER 1: Direct from inputs
────────────────────────────────────────────────
inputs/voc/*            → outputs/insights/voc-synthesis-*.md
inputs/jira/*           → outputs/ktlo/ktlo-triage-*.md
inputs/roadmap_deck/*   → outputs/truth_base/truth-base.md
inputs/product_demo/*   → outputs/truth_base/truth-base.md
inputs/knowledge_base/* → outputs/truth_base/truth-base.md
                        → outputs/insights/kb-gaps-*.md

TIER 2: Depends on Tier 1
────────────────────────────────────────────────
outputs/truth_base/*    → outputs/roadmap/Qx-*-charters.md
outputs/insights/voc-*  → outputs/roadmap/Qx-*-charters.md
outputs/ktlo/*          → outputs/roadmap/Qx-*-charters.md

TIER 3: Depends on Tier 2
────────────────────────────────────────────────
outputs/roadmap/*       → outputs/delivery/prds/*.md
```

When upstream changes, downstream becomes stale.

---

## Evidence Rules

All outputs follow these rules (enforced by skills):

1. **Never invent** metrics, customers, or quotes
2. **Every claim tagged:** Evidence / Assumption / Open Question
3. **Every output includes:** Sources Used section
4. **Every major claim has:** Claims Ledger entry
5. **Missing data:** Explicitly stated before proceeding

---

## Common Workflows

| What You Want | Command / Prompt |
|---------------|------------------|
| Triage support backlog | `/ktlo` |
| Analyze customer feedback | `/voc` |
| Generate exec update | `/exec-update` |
| Plan the quarter | `/charters` |
| Map stakeholders | `/stakeholders` |
| Create GTM plan | `/gtm` |
| Write product strategy | `/strategy` |
| Review launch outcomes | `/review` |
| Build product understanding | "Run building-truth-base" |
| Find KB gaps | "Run analyzing-kb-gaps" |
| Write a PRD | "Run writing-prds-from-charters for [charter name]" |
| Check what's stale | "What outputs are stale?" |
| See last week's work | "What did I run last week?" |
| Refresh stale output | "Refresh [skill-name]" |
| Analyze learning patterns | "Analyze patterns from [skill-name] history" |

---

## Getting Started

### Day 1 (New Role)
1. Drop any onboarding docs into `inputs/roadmap_deck/`
2. Add demo notes to `inputs/product_demo/`
3. Run `building-truth-base`
4. Review output, note open questions

### Ongoing
- Drop new VOC/tickets as you get them
- Run skills when you need their outputs
- Claude tracks staleness and suggests refreshes

---

## Key Features

### 1. Command-Based Workflow
Short commands like `/ktlo`, `/voc`, `/charters` invoke local skills. No plugin dependency.

**How it works:**
- Commands in `commands/*.md` invoke skills in `skills/*/SKILL.md`
- Simple wrapper: `disable-model-invocation: true` + "Read and follow skills/X/SKILL.md"

### 2. Automatic Learning System
Mines `history/` directories for patterns, writes to `.claude/rules/learned/` (auto-loaded).

**How it works:**
- Session hook runs every 7 days (or force with `--force`)
- Analyzes success/failure patterns from versioned outputs
- Quantifies confidence: Strong (≥80%), Medium (50-80%), Weak (<50%)
- Updates `CLAUDE.local.md` with personal preferences
- System gets smarter over time

### 3. Modular Rules Architecture
Rules organized in `.claude/rules/` with auto-discovery:
- **pm-core/**: Evidence rules, metadata standards, decision algorithm
- **domain/**: Vocabulary (Business Network, Catalogs, CPG terms)
- **system/**: Staleness protocol, output destinations
- **pm-workflows/**: Charter and PRD rules (path-specific)
- **learned/**: Auto-generated patterns from learning system

See `.claude/MODULAR_RULES_VERIFICATION.md` for details.

### 4. Senior PM Coverage
Beyond IC-level (VOC, KTLO, charters, PRDs) to Senior PM:
- Stakeholder mapping and alignment tracking
- GTM/launch planning (market analysis, positioning, enablement)
- Multi-year product strategy (vision, pillars, capability roadmap, moats)
- Post-launch retrospectives (lessons learned, process improvements)
