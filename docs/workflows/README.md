# Product Management Workflows

## Purpose

This directory contains high-level, human-readable "playbooks" or "recipes" for accomplishing complex, recurring product management tasks. They are guides for the user, not machine-executable instructions.

## Workflows vs. Skills

It is crucial to understand the distinction between a **workflow** and a **skill**:

-   **Workflows (this directory):** These are human-readable guides that show you *how* and *when* to combine multiple skills into a coherent sequence. They are the "recipes."
-   **Skills (`/skills/`):** These are the atomic, machine-executable actions that perform a specific task. They are the "ingredients."

Workflows provide the strategic context and step-by-step process, telling you which skills to run to achieve a larger goal like "planning a quarter" or "reviewing a launch."

## Available Workflows

| Workflow | Description |

| [**Weekly Planning**](./weekly-planning.md) | A weekly process to refine and generate quarterly charters based on the latest data from your daily routines. |
