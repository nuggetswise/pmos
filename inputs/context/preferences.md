# PREFERENCES: Your Style

## Communication Style

| Aspect | Preference |
|--------|------------|
| Tone | Professional, direct, no fluff |
| Length | Concise - get to the point |
| Format | Tables preferred over paragraphs for comparisons |
| Emojis | Minimal - only for status indicators (✅ 🔴 🟡) |
| Jargon | Use PM terminology (VOC, KTLO, GTM) - I know it |

## Output Preferences

| Output Type | Format Preference |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Analysis | Decision-first, then evidence |
| Status updates | Bullet points, max 1 page |
| Recommendations | Ranked options with tradeoffs |
| PRDs | Structured sections, SHALL/SHOULD/MAY requirements |
| Emails | Short, action-oriented, clear ask |

## Working Style

| Aspect | Preference |
|--------|------------|
| Planning | Like to see the full picture before diving in |
| Execution | Prefer systematic progress over ad-hoc |
| Feedback | Direct and constructive, don't sugarcoat |
| Interruptions | Minimize - prefer focused work blocks |
| Collaboration | Async preferred, sync for complex discussions |

## Operating Cadence

| Ritual | Frequency | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Sprint planning | Biweekly | Scope work |
| Roadmap review | Quarterly | Align priorities with leadership |
| Customer discovery | Weekly | Build evidence base for decisions |
| PM OS review | Daily (morning) | KTLO triage, VOC synthesis, status |

## Tools & Systems

| Category | Preferred Tool |

| PM work | PM OS (Claude Code) |

## What Helps Me

- Clear structure and templates
- Evidence-based recommendations
- Explicit tradeoffs stated
- Next actions always clear
- Links to sources

## What Frustrates Me

- Vague recommendations without evidence
- Long-winded explanations (get to the point)
- Missing context (always tell me why)
- Overly cautious hedging (give me your actual opinion)
- Surprises in meetings (prep me in advance)

## Response Preferences by Situation

### When I ask "What's next?"
Give me: Top 3 prioritized actions aligned to COMPASS goals, with brief rationale

### When I ask for analysis
Give me: Decision-first summary, then supporting evidence in tables

### When I ask for help with writing
Give me: Draft in my communication style, ready to send with minor edits

### When I hit a blocker
Give me: Options to resolve, tradeoffs of each, recommended path

### When I need to present to leadership
Give me: Executive summary format, metrics-focused, risks visible

## Learning Preferences

| Aspect | Preference |
|--------|------------|
| New concepts | Show me an example first |
| Complex topics | Break into digestible steps |
| Corrections | Tell me directly, explain why |
| Exploration | Ask me clarifying questions vs assume |
