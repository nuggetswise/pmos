# COMPASS: Mission, Goals, Beliefs

## Mission Statement

Transform Active Catalog from a PO-enablement tool into a **rich product content hub** that leverages Business Network scale as a competitive moat, driving growth through AI-enabled capabilities.

## Role

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Title | Lead Product Manager |
| Scope | Active Catalog product line (end-to-end ownership) |
| Reports To | Senior Director, Business Network |
| Team | Dev, Sales, PS, Product Marketing, UX (cross-functional) |

## Goals (This Quarter)

| Restart product management via customer discovery | 10+ customer interviews, win-loss analysis | In Progress |
| Define future vision and growth strategy | Vision doc approved by leadership | Not Started |

## Long-Term Goals (This Year)

| Goal | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| Shift from KTLO to growth mode | Unlock innovation, not just maintenance |
| Launch AI-enabled capabilities | Differentiate vs competitors |
| Expand beyond GS1 soft goods | New customers, new categories |

## Beliefs (Decision Principles)

1. **Customer value first** - Solve real user pain, not hypothetical problems
2. **Evidence over opinion** - Win-loss analysis, customer discovery before bets
3. **Leverage BN network** - Use Business Network scale as competitive moat
4. **AI as unlock** - Prioritize AI-enabled capabilities for differentiation

## Domain Knowledge

| Know Well | Learning |
|-----------|----------|
| B2B enterprise software | Active Catalog architecture |
| Product strategy | GS1/GTIN standards |
| Agile/Scrum | OpenText Business Network ecosystem |
| Cloud platforms | Retail/CPG domain specifics |
| Customer discovery | |

## Key Stakeholders

| Name | Role | What They Care About | How to Influence |
|------|------|---------------------|------------------|
| VP | Executive Sponsor | Growth metrics, commercial success, adoption | Data-backed investment cases, clear ROI |
| Senior Director | Manager | Future vision, strategic bets, BN integration | Strategic roadmap, customer evidence |
| Business Team | GTM Partners | PO enablement → product content hub positioning | Proof points, customer success stories |
| Engineering | Delivery | Scope clarity, technical feasibility, debt reduction | Clear requirements, realistic timelines |
| Sales/CS | Revenue | Competitive positioning, customer pain points | Win-loss analysis, differentiation |

## Strategic Context

### Growth Vectors (from Senior Director)
- **New customers/categories:** Expand beyond GS1 soft goods to hard goods, groceries
- **More value for existing:** Faster onboarding, better capabilities, improved UX

### AI Opportunities
- Supplier side: Increase velocity of SKU creation/publication
- Retailer side: Contextual Gen-AI discovery across suppliers/SKUs
- Semantic search: Handle variations (black vs BLK vs BLK.)
- Auto-extraction: PDFs, images, CSVs for faster supplier onboarding

### Competitive Positioning
- Competitors (Syndigo, PIM tools) have strong apps but lack BN's network scale
- Position Active Catalog as more than PO enablement: rich product content hub
- Support land-and-expand: Catalog → Trading Grid/B2B → other BN products

## Primary Metrics (How I'm Judged)

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Growth within Active Catalog customer base | TBD | TBD | Baseline needed |
| Usage/volume increase | TBD | TBD | Baseline needed |
| Adoption of new capabilities | TBD | TBD | Baseline needed |
| Commercial success (customers paying more) | TBD | TBD | Baseline needed |
