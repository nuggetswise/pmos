# CHALLENGES: Obstacles and Constraints

## Active Blockers

| Blocker | Impact | Owner | Resolution Path |
|---------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| No established customer interview pipeline | Can't gather VOC evidence | Me + Sales | Work with CS/Sales to identify contacts |
| Metrics baseline undefined | Can't measure success | Me | Set up analytics dashboard |

## Persistent Constraints

| Constraint | Impact | Mitigation | Severity |
|------------|--------|------------|----------|
| **Legacy codebase** (5+ years without innovation) | Technical debt limits velocity, UX outdated | Prioritize incremental modernization, not big bang | 🔴 High |
| **KTLO mindset** (team focused on maintenance) | Resistance to new feature work | Build case for growth investment, show customer pain | 🟡 Medium |
| **Data quality issues** (free-form fields, normalization) | Limits value of AI features | Define data standards, gradual cleanup | 🟡 Medium |
| **New PM on product** (learning curve) | Slower decision velocity initially | Use PM OS for systematic learning | 🟢 Low |
| **Increased SKU complexity** (3x more SKUs since 2020) | Management overhead, data integrity issues | Automate data handling, review data models | 🔴 High |
| **Rapid retail channel expansion** (5-7 new channels) | Strain on integration and catalog management | Standardize integration, scale platform | 🔴 High |
| **Manual supplier onboarding** (unstructured data) | Slows time-to-market, error-prone | Implement data extraction tools (OCR, AI) | 🔴 High |
| **Accelerated launch cycles** (months to weeks) | Increased pressure, potential quality issues | Streamline processes, improve automation | 🔴 High |
| **Lack of AI innovation** (5+ years) | Competitive disadvantage, missed opportunities | Prioritize AI-led product innovations | 🔴 High |

## Risks to Current Initiatives

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Customers unwilling to interview | Medium | High - blocks VOC | Offer incentives, use Sales relationships |
| Competitive analysis takes too long | Low | Medium - delays charters | Timebox to 2 weeks, use AI for research |
| Engineering pushback on AI features | Medium | High - blocks roadmap | Early tech spike, involve eng in discovery |
| Leadership changes Q1 priorities | Low | High - wasted planning | Align early, get explicit sign-off |

## Resource Constraints

| Resource | Constraint | Impact |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Engineering capacity | 80% KTLO, 20% new features | Limited ability to execute on vision |
| Budget | TBD for FY26 | May limit AI/ML investments |
| Time | Competing priorities (KTLO, discovery, planning) | Need ruthless prioritization |

## Dependencies

| Dependency | What I Need | From Whom | Status |
|------------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Customer contacts | List of interview candidates | Sales/CS | 🟡 Requested |
| Win-loss data | Last 12 months analysis | CS team | 🟡 Requested |
| Tech architecture docs | Current system understanding | Engineering | 🔴 Not started |
| Competitive intel | Syndigo/Salsify analysis | Product Marketing | 🔴 Not started |

## Resolved Challenges (Archive)

| Challenge | Resolution | Learnings |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| No PM system | Implemented PM OS | Structure enables systematic work |

## Challenge Patterns

### Recurring Themes
1. **Information gaps** - Need better access to customer data, competitive intel
2. **Capacity constraints** - Team stretched between KTLO and growth
3. **Legacy burden** - Technical debt slows everything

### What Works
- Building relationships with Sales/CS for customer access
- Using PM OS to systematize work
- Evidence-based arguments with leadership

### What Doesn't Work
- Assuming data exists (it usually doesn't)
- Big bang transformation plans (too much resistance)
- Working in isolation (need cross-functional buy-in)
