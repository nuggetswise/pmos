# My Context

## Role
- Title: Lead Product Manager
- Scope: Active Catalog product line (end-to-end ownership)
- Team: Dev, Sales, PS, Product Marketing, UX (cross-functional)
- Reports to: Senior Director, Business Network

## Domain Knowledge
- I understand: B2B enterprise software, product strategy, Agile/Scrum, cloud platforms, customer discovery
- I'm learning: Active Catalog architecture, GS1/GTIN standards, OpenText Business Network ecosystem, Retail/CPG domain specifics

## Key Stakeholders
| Name | Role | What They Care About | How to Influence |
|------|------|---------------------|------------------|
| VP | Executive Sponsor | Growth metrics, commercial success, adoption | Data-backed investment cases, clear ROI |
| Senior Director | Manager | Future vision, strategic bets, BN integration | Strategic roadmap, customer evidence |
| Business Team | GTM Partners | PO enablement → product content hub positioning | Proof points, customer success stories |
| Engineering | Delivery | Scope clarity, technical feasibility, debt reduction | Clear requirements, realistic timelines |
| Sales/CS | Revenue | Competitive positioning vs Syndigo, customer pain points | Win-loss analysis, differentiation |

## Current Priorities (This Quarter)
1. Assess where Active Catalog is today vs competitors (Syndigo, PIM tools)
2. Win-loss analysis and customer discovery (restart product management)
3. Define future vision and growth strategy for Active Catalog

## Constraints
| Type | Constraint | Impact |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Legacy | 5+ years without significant innovation | Technical debt, UX modernization needed |
| KTLO Mode | Team focused on maintenance, not growth | Need to shift mindset to product development |
| Data Quality | Free-form fields, inconsistent terms, normalization issues | Limits value delivery |

## Operating Cadence
| Ritual | Frequency | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Sprint planning | Biweekly | Scope work |
| Roadmap review | Quarterly | Align priorities with leadership |
| Customer discovery | Weekly | Build evidence base for decisions |

## Primary Metrics (How I'm Judged)
| Metric | Current | Target | Owner |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| Growth within Active Catalog customer base | TBD | TBD | Me |
| Usage/volume increase | TBD | TBD | Me |
| Adoption of new capabilities | TBD | TBD | Me |
| Commercial success (customers paying more) | TBD | TBD | Me |

## Decision Principles
1. Customer value first - solve real user pain, not hypothetical problems
2. Evidence over opinion - win-loss analysis, customer discovery before bets
3. Leverage BN network - use Business Network scale as competitive moat
4. AI as unlock - prioritize AI-enabled capabilities for differentiation

## Strategic Context

### Growth Vectors (from Senior Director)
- **New customers/categories:** Expand beyond GS1 soft goods to hard goods, groceries
- **More value for existing:** Faster onboarding, better capabilities, improved UX

### AI Opportunities
- Supplier side: Increase velocity of SKU creation/publication
- Retailer side: Contextual Gen-AI discovery across suppliers/SKUs
- Semantic search: Handle variations (black vs BLK vs BLK.)
- Auto-extraction: PDFs, images, CSVs for faster supplier onboarding

### Competitive Positioning
- Competitors (Syndigo, PIM tools) have strong apps but lack BN's network scale
- Position Active Catalog as more than PO enablement: rich product content hub
- Support land-and-expand: Catalog → Trading Grid/B2B → other BN products
