Read and follow the brainstorming skill at `skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md`.

This skill should be used before any creative PM work:
- Creating features or new capabilities
- Building components or systems
- Adding functionality to existing products
- Modifying product behavior
- Before writing charters or PRDs
- When stuck on a problem

The brainstorming skill explores problem space, generates options, and validates thinking before implementation.
