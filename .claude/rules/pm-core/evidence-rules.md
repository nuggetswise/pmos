# Evidence Rules (Non-Negotiable)

These rules apply to ALL PM outputs. Violating evidence discipline creates false confidence in bad bets.

## Core Principles

1. **NEVER invent** metrics, customers, roadmap facts, or quotes
2. **Every output** must include a **Sources Used** section (list file paths)
3. **Every major claim** tagged as:
   - `Evidence` - directly from source file
   - `Assumption` - inferred, needs validation
   - `Open Question` - unknown, needs research
4. **If data missing:** explicitly state what you need before proceeding

## Claims Ledger

Every output must include a Claims Ledger at the end:

| Claim | Type | Source |
|-------|------|--------|
| [claim] | Evidence/Assumption/Open Question | [file:line or "N/A"] |

## Validation Checklist

Before marking any output complete:

- [ ] **Sources section exists** - All input files listed
- [ ] **Claims Ledger present** - Table exists at end
- [ ] **Every claim tagged** - Type: Evidence / Assumption / Open Question
- [ ] **Evidence claims have sources** - File path + line number
- [ ] **Assumptions flagged** - Marked for validation
- [ ] **No untagged claims** - Check for missing tags
- [ ] **Verbatim quotes attributed** - Exact source (file:line)
- [ ] **Counts are exact** - "4 of 7 sources" not "many" or "several"
- [ ] **Unknowns marked** - "Unknown", "Need data", "Not stated" where appropriate

## Why This Matters

A charter with invented customer quotes or fabricated metrics is worse than no charter—it creates false confidence in bad bets.
