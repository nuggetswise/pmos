# Mode: Vision Communication

## Purpose

Tone and structure rules for inspiring, forward-looking communications that build excitement and alignment around a future state. Use when presenting strategy, launching initiatives, or rallying teams.

## When to Apply

- Product vision presentations
- Strategy kickoffs
- All-hands announcements
- Roadmap communications
- Any output with `--mode vision` flag

## Core Principles

### 1. Paint the Destination, Not Just the Path

**Tactical:** "We'll implement event-driven architecture to reduce sync latency"
**Visionary:** "Imagine a world where catalog updates happen instantly—suppliers see changes the moment retailers make them"

Show what success **feels like**, not just what you'll build.

### 2. Connect to Purpose

Every vision connects to something bigger:

| Level | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **Individual** | "You'll spend less time on manual sync fixes" |
| **Team** | "Our reliability will become a competitive advantage" |
| **Company** | "We'll unlock new market segments" |
| **Customer** | "Retailers will never lose a sale to stale data" |
| **Industry** | "We're setting the new standard for B2B data exchange" |

### 3. Acknowledge the Journey

Vision without acknowledging difficulty feels naive:

**Naive:** "This will be easy and everything will be great"
**Credible:** "This is hard. It'll take a year. But here's why it's worth it..."

### 4. Make It Tangible

Abstract vision needs concrete anchors:

**Abstract:** "We'll transform the customer experience"
**Tangible:** "When Acme's buyer searches for 'blue widgets', they'll see live inventory from 50 suppliers—not day-old data"

## Output Structure

## Tone Guidelines

| Element | Approach | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Opening** | Bold statement | "The future of B2B commerce is real-time." |
| **Challenge** | Honest but optimistic | "This won't be easy—but nothing worth doing is." |
| **Ask** | Invitational | "I need your help to make this real." |
| **Close** | Inspiring | "Let's build something our customers will thank us for." |

## Language Patterns

### Use Future-Present Tense

Write about the future as if it's already happening:

**Future tense:** "Customers will be able to..."
**Future-present:** "Imagine: It's 2027. A buyer searches for products and..."

### Use "We" Language

**Distancing:** "The company will invest..."
**Inclusive:** "We're going to build..."

### Balance Aspiration with Credibility

| Too Soft | Too Aggressive | Just Right |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| "We hope to improve..." | "We will dominate..." | "We're positioning to lead..." |
| "Maybe we could..." | "This will definitely..." | "Our path to X is clear..." |

## The Vision Ladder

Scale your vision language to audience:

| Audience | Focus | Example |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Executives** | Business outcomes | "This unlocks a $50M market" |
| **Team leads** | Capability building | "Your teams will ship 2x faster" |
| **Individual contributors** | Day-to-day impact | "No more weekend sync fires" |
| **Customers** | Their success | "Your buyers find products in seconds" |
| **Partners** | Mutual growth | "Together we'll set the industry standard" |

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Instead |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **All hype, no substance** | Loses credibility | Ground vision in evidence |
| **Too many details** | Overwhelms, loses inspiration | Save details for roadmap |
| **No acknowledgment of difficulty** | Seems naive | "This is hard, and worth it" |
| **Generic platitudes** | Forgettable | Specific, tangible examples |
| **No ask** | Vision without action | Clear call to action |
| **Solo language ("I")** | Excludes team | Inclusive "we" language |

## Quality Gates

Before sending vision communication:

- [ ] Opens with inspiring statement (not logistics)
- [ ] Future state is tangible (someone could draw it)
- [ ] Connects to audience's self-interest
- [ ] Acknowledges the difficulty of the journey
- [ ] Includes measurable success criteria
- [ ] Has clear ask/call to action
- [ ] Closes with inspiration, not logistics

## Integration

Apply this mode to any skill output:

```
/strategy --mode vision
/charters --mode vision
/exec-update --mode vision  # For initiative announcements
```

## Combining Modes

Vision mode can combine with narrative structure:

```
/strategy --mode vision --story-mode
```

This creates a vision document structured as Context → Conflict → Resolution, with visionary tone throughout.
