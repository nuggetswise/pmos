# Bridge and Pivot

## Purpose

Patterns for handling curveballs, off-topic questions, and unexpected challenges while staying on message. Use when conversations veer off-track or when you're caught off-guard.

## When to Apply

- Unexpected questions in presentations
- Conversations going off-topic
- Being asked about areas outside your expertise
- Hostile or loaded questions
- Any situation requiring `/pivot` skill

## Core Principles

### 1. Never Lie or Evade

Pivoting is about steering the conversation, not dodging accountability:

**Evasion:** "That's not what we're here to discuss"
**Bridge:** "That's important. Let me address it, then connect back to..."

### 2. Acknowledge the Question

Even when pivoting away, acknowledge what was asked:

**Dismissive:** "Let's stay focused on..."
**Acknowledging:** "Good question about X. Here's my quick take, and it connects to..."

### 3. Bridge to Your Key Message

Have 2-3 key messages you want to land. Every pivot should connect back to one of them.

### 4. Stay Calm

Curveballs test your composure. A calm response builds credibility even if you don't have the perfect answer.

## The ABC Framework

**A**cknowledge → **B**ridge → **C**ommunicate

### Acknowledge

Show you heard the question:
- "That's a fair question."
- "I understand why you'd ask that."
- "Good point—let me address it."

### Bridge

Transition phrase to your message:
- "And what's most relevant here is..."
- "What I can tell you is..."
- "The bigger picture is..."
- "Here's what I know for certain..."

### Communicate

Deliver your key message:
- Keep it concise (10-15 seconds)
- Use evidence when possible
- Return to your agenda

## Common Curveball Types

### Off-Topic Questions

**Curveball:** "What about the mobile app roadmap?"
*(When presenting catalog sync strategy)*

| Step | Response |
|------|----------|
| Acknowledge | "Mobile is important to our strategy." |
| Bridge | "For today's discussion on sync—" |
| Communicate | "—I want to focus on the foundation that enables mobile later. Let's table mobile for the next session." |

### Hostile Questions

**Curveball:** "Isn't this just another failed initiative like Project X?"

| Step | Response |
|------|----------|
| Acknowledge | "Project X didn't meet expectations. I understand the skepticism." |
| Bridge | "What's different this time—" |
| Communicate | "—is [specific difference: evidence, approach, team]. I'm happy to walk through the risk mitigations." |

### "I Don't Know" Situations

**Curveball:** "What's the exact revenue impact?"
*(When you don't have the number)*

| Step | Response |
|------|----------|
| Acknowledge | "I don't have that exact figure today." |
| Bridge | "What I can share—" |
| Communicate | "—is that 3 customers cited this in renewal negotiations. I'll get you the revenue number by [date]." |

**Never:** Make up numbers. "I'll follow up" is always better than fabrication.

### Loaded Questions

**Curveball:** "Why did you ignore engineering's concerns?"

| Step | Response |
|------|----------|
| Acknowledge | "I didn't ignore them—let me clarify what happened." |
| Bridge | "The decision process included—" |
| Communicate | "—three reviews with engineering. We addressed [concern A] by [change]. [Concern B] was a trade-off we made consciously because [reason]." |

### Premature Detail Questions

**Curveball:** "What's the database schema for this?"
*(In a strategy presentation)*

| Step | Response |
|------|----------|
| Acknowledge | "Great question for the technical deep-dive." |
| Bridge | "At this stage—" |
| Communicate | "—I want to align on the 'what' before the 'how'. Let's schedule a technical review for [date]." |

### "What About..." Scope Expansion

**Curveball:** "What about internationalization? And accessibility? And..."

| Step | Response |
|------|----------|
| Acknowledge | "Those are all important considerations." |
| Bridge | "For this phase—" |
| Communicate | "—we're focused on [scope]. I've captured those as future requirements. Here's how we're sequencing..." |

## Bridge Phrase Library

### Redirecting to Key Message

- "And what's most important here is..."
- "Let me connect that to our core objective..."
- "The key point I want to make is..."
- "Here's what I know for certain..."

### Deferring Without Dismissing

- "That deserves a fuller discussion. For now..."
- "Let me take that offline and come back with..."
- "I want to give that proper attention. Today..."
- "Great topic for our next session. Right now..."

### Handling Unknowns

- "I don't have that information today, but..."
- "That's outside my expertise. What I can say is..."
- "Let me verify and follow up. In the meantime..."
- "I'd rather get you the right answer than guess..."

### Reframing the Question

- "If I understand your concern correctly..."
- "The underlying question seems to be..."
- "Let me reframe that slightly..."
- "What I think you're really asking is..."

## The Pivot Skill

**Usage:** `/pivot <curveball>`

**Output Format:**

```markdown
## Curveball
[Restated challenge]

## Classification
[Off-topic | Hostile | Unknown | Loaded | Scope expansion]

## Response Options

### Option 1: Direct Bridge
**Acknowledge:** [Script]
**Bridge:** [Transition phrase]
**Communicate:** [Key message]

### Option 2: Defer Gracefully
**Script:** [Full response]
**Follow-up commitment:** [What you'll provide and when]

### Option 3: Reframe
**Script:** [How to reframe the question to something answerable]

## Key Messages to Return To
1. [Your main point]
2. [Supporting evidence]
3. [Clear ask]
```

## Preparation Strategy

### Before High-Stakes Meetings

1. **Identify your 3 key messages**
   - What must the audience remember?
   - What evidence supports each?

2. **Anticipate curveballs**
   - What are they likely to ask?
   - What would be the hardest question?
   - What don't you know?

3. **Prepare bridges**
   - Draft transition phrases for each anticipated curveball
   - Practice saying them naturally

### The "Pocket Answer"

For topics you know will come up but aren't the focus, prepare a 15-second "pocket answer":

**Topic:** Mobile roadmap (not today's focus)
**Pocket answer:** "Mobile is on our 2027 roadmap. Today's sync improvements are foundational—they'll make mobile faster to build when we get there. Happy to discuss mobile timing separately."

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Instead |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **"No comment"** | Sounds evasive | Acknowledge + bridge |
| **Rambling** | Looks unprepared | Crisp ABC response |
| **Getting defensive** | Escalates tension | Stay calm, acknowledge |
| **Making things up** | Destroys credibility | "I'll follow up" |
| **Ignoring the question** | Seems dismissive | Always acknowledge |
| **Over-bridging** | Sounds like spin | Be genuine |

## Staying Calm Under Pressure

### Physical Techniques

- Pause before responding (2 seconds feels long to you, normal to them)
- Take a breath
- Maintain eye contact
- Keep hands visible and still

### Mental Techniques

- Remember: they're questioning the idea, not you personally
- You don't have to have all answers immediately
- "I'll follow up" is a professional response
- Silence after their question is okay

### Recovery Phrases

If you stumble:
- "Let me start over."
- "Let me put that more clearly."
- "Actually, the better way to say this is..."

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Paused to compose response (don't react immediately)
- [ ] Acknowledged the question genuinely
- [ ] Used bridge phrase naturally (not robotically)
- [ ] Returned to key message
- [ ] Stayed calm and composed
- [ ] Made follow-up commitment if needed

## Integration

```
/pivot "Why should we trust this will work when Project X failed?"
