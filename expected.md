I will join the company where team is mostly working in keep the lights on mode. The product is $27 Mn product as per my discussion with VP: 
-   **Own Active Catalog like a “CEO of the product”**
    
    -   Drive collaboration across dev, sales, PS, etc.
    -   “Own the outcome” even though you don’t manage those teams.
-   **Restart real product management for Active Catalog**
    
    -   Do win–loss analysis and customer discovery (which they’re not doing now).
    -   Assess where the product is today, especially vs. Cindigo and other PIM tools.
    -   Prioritize and drive a roadmap, not just “keep the lights on” maintenance.
-   **Deliver growth for Active Catalog**
    
    -   Main metric he called out: **growth within the Active Catalog customer base**, especially usage/volume and new logos if possible.
    -   Improve **adoption** of new capabilities you ship.
    -   Achieve **commercial success** (customers paying more because they see value).
-   **Use AI and UX improvements to make the product competitive**
    
    -   Modernize a product that’s had “not much innovation” in 5+ years.
    -   Focus on things like faster self‑service supplier onboarding, better experience for hubs and spokes, and catching up on AI‑enabled capabilities.
-   **Support land‑and‑expand in BN**
    
    -   Use Active Catalog as an entry point that leads customers into **Trading Grid/B2B integration** and then other BN products.

    Business team: 

    **Pain point / current mindset**

-   Retailers often see Active Catalog as “only for getting a PO out” with basic attributes (GTIN, size, style, color).
-   There’s still **data normalization issues** (free‑form fields, inconsistent terms) and **growing complexity** (more SKUs, more channels, extended attributes).

Position Catalog as **more than PO enablement**: a rich **product content hub** supporting extended attributes, images, and e‑commerce use cases


Senior Director- reporting Manager: 

Key elements of his vision for Active Catalog, in more detail:

### 1. From solid business to future growth engine
- He said Active Catalog is already a **“very, very sizable business”** and **“very embedded in many of the retailers”**, but:
  - *“I see we're missing that future vision of where we wanna take it to be even better.”*
- He wants someone to **develop that future strategy**, not just maintain the current book of business.

### 2. Growth vectors he called out
He repeatedly framed growth as both **new and existing customers**:

- **New customers / categories**
  - Move beyond GS1 soft-goods focus:
    - *“GS1 is very good for soft goods. Right? But there're also hard goods. There're also groceries. There's also whole bunch of other… the request for catalog.”*
  - Expand categories Active Catalog can cover so more retailers and suppliers can use it.

- **More value for existing customers**
  - *“Even within the existing customers, there are definitely growth potential if we're focusing on capturing and publishing the catalog… What other things can we do right, to maybe faster onboarding…?”*
  - Improve **capabilities, speed, and usability**, not just basic “capture & publish”.

### 3. Multi‑channel and scale problems
He agreed with your analysis and reinforced it:

- Retail is now **multi‑channel**:
  - Physical + digital + marketplaces + regional channels.
  - They need to **re‑think catalog** in that context.
- Massive growth in SKUs and channels:
  - *“The retail and the space has been enormously increased.”*
  - Active Catalog needs to help manage that scale efficiently for both sides (suppliers and retailers).

### 4. Serving both suppliers and retailers
He sees Active Catalog as sitting between two “masters”:

- **Suppliers**:
  - Need to get their catalogs **onboarded and published quickly**:
    - *“How do we help enable and support suppliers, for example, to have their catalog register faster and with ease?”*
  - If suppliers see strong value, they **choose OpenText as their catalog company**.

- **Retailers**:
  - Need to **find and consume** product information better:
    - *“How we can help retailers consume those catalog because, again, they're making purchasing decisions but the truth is… they likely look at the whole catalog and you're like, okay. Where where's it?”*
  - Wants Active Catalog to be a **key tool for retailer decision‑making**, not just a data pipe.

### 5. AI as a major unlock
He sees AI as underused in catalog and a huge opportunity:

- **Current obvious use case:**
  - Search and summarization over “mountains and mountains of data”.
- **Deeper potential he wants to explore:**
  - Supplier side:
    - Increase **velocity and productivity** of SKU creation and publication.
  - Retailer side:
    - More **contextual, Gen‑AI style discovery** across many suppliers and SKUs.
- His framing:
  - *“I see tremendous opportunity here… not just here in Active Catalog. I see that across all BN.”*
  - *“AI bringing in unforeseen benefits that no one is even thinking about today.”*

You also added concrete AI ideas he clearly liked:
- Semantic search (e.g., “black” vs “BLK” / “BLK.” variations).
- Automated extraction from PDFs, images, CSVs to speed supplier onboarding.
- Better product findability for retailers → more usage and retention.

### 6. Using Business Network as the “superpower”
He explicitly connects Active Catalog to BN’s broader network:

- BN as **“central nervous system”** of many enterprises via EDI/integration.
- Active Catalog as an **application/value‑add** on top of that network:
  - *“How does Active Catalog fit into the bigger Business Network scheme?”*
  - *“How do we contribute, towards the bigger retail CPG and brand strategy?”*
- He wants to exploit this advantage vs competitors:
  - Others may have strong apps, but **don’t have BN’s network scale**.
  - Active Catalog should be a core part of the **retail/CPG/brands vertical strategy**.

### 7. Strategic gap he wants you to fill
Across the conversation, he implied the current gaps:

- Lots of **discussion but “not a lot of actions”** on:
  - Multi‑channel support
  - New categories
  - Faster onboarding
  - AI‑driven value
- No strong, unified **future vision** yet:
  - *“We have a very, very sizable business in it, but we… we're missing that future vision… There’s a lot of missed opportunities… where we can leverage the scale we have to expand.”*
- He is explicitly looking for a **Lead PM to:**
  - Do product discovery with customers/sales.
  - Formulate the **growth strategy**.
  - Build a data‑backed investment case.
  - “Take it and bring it to reality.”
