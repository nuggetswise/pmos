I presented this assignment to VP during interview process : 

Active Catalog: Vision & Execution Plan
Define Vision
Customer Pain-points
Manual data entry from PDFs delays time-to-shelf by months, costing retailers and suppliers revenue. Catalog errors cost
suppliers $80+ per chargeback, eroding margins. Manual workload doesn't scale and hit growth with suppliers managing
3x more SKUs vs 2020 and 5-7 retail channels.
The Vision Active Catalog accelerates time-to-shelf for retailers and suppliers, eliminates chargebacks through real-time
validation, and scales as suppliers manage more products across multiple channels.
Execution Strategy: Year 1
Strategy: Solve the supplier data ingestion bottleneck first, then leverage the Network to monetize by validating
transactions in real-time, aligning with the land and expand business
Phase Activities
Phase 1:
Discovery and
Validation
(Months 1-4)
90-day Discovery and Roadmap Approval Process:
1. Discovery: Interview 15+ Customers and market research to validate "Manual Entry"
friction. Audit current usage data (or implement Pendo/Mixpanel) to identify friction
points and expected user flows.
2. Technical Assessment: Evaluate non-AI approach for the Phase 1 Pilot. Investigate
feasibility of the Phase 2 "Network Integration" (Catalog to EDI).
3. Define Roadmap: Create Product Charter & Align with BN Strategy. Lock the year 1
roadmap and secure leadership approval for the Phase 1 Pilot.
4. Day 90: Baseline metrics quantified, pilot technology selected, team aligned on strategy
Execution: Month 4
1. Launch Pilot: Deploy "PDF-to-Data" extraction tool with 3-5 high-volume supplier-
retailer pairs.
2. Test Validation: Pilot specific semantic rules (GTIN, Price Tolerance) to measure error
detection rates.
Decision Gate 1. 2. 3. Speed-to-Publish: Has the pilot reduced onboarding time by at least X%
Error Reduction: Has the pilot reduced data-driven chargebacks by at least Y%
Customer Readiness: Do pilot customers confirm they see value in "Network
Validation" and would be willing to pay for Phase 2?
Phase 2:
AI & Network
Integration
(Months 5-12)
1. 2. Native AI data extraction: Replace 3rd party tools with proprietary AI models
Transaction Rule-based Validation: Real-time PO validation against Active Catalog at
Trading Grid prevents order errors before they reach suppliers reducing chargebacks
Success Metrics
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Chargeback Reduction for integrated customers (primary retention driver)
Time-to-Publish reduction from Phase 1 baseline (retention & acquisition driver)
Transaction Accuracy improvement from Phase 1 baseline (acquisition driver)
Network Adoption: 30%+ of top 100 customers using validation (stickiness indicator; enables cross-sell)
Secure mandate from 3-5 major hubs to mandate Active Catalog for their suppliers (land & expand growth)
