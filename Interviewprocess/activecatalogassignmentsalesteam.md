Active Catalog: Strategic Vision & Execution Plan to Sales and Engg team
1. Vision
The Opportunity Business Network reliably moves B2B transactions at scale, but today it focuses on transporting them
rather than fully leveraging their context from Active Catalog.
The Vision Active Catalog becomes the Intelligence Layer for Business Network—effortlessly ingesting supplier data,
maintaining clean master product data, and enabling real-time validation and enrichment of transactions against that
trusted source.
2. Execution Strategy → Year 1
Strategy: We solve the ingestion and then we leverage the Network's strength by making it easier for retailers to validate
supply chain flow
Phase Activities
Phase 1:
Discovery and
Modernization (Months 1-
6)
Accelerate Ingestion (The Senses)
Validate the impact (more retention/acquisition) of on-boarding pain point
Explore non-AI low effort approach to speedup onboarding
Investigate and validate AC and BN integration effort vs revenue
Gather Usage data of friction points
Define strategy and roadmap aligned with discovery and stakeholder input
Decision Gate Data Value Check
Gate Criteria: Have the 3rd party tool reduced onboarding time by 30%? Do customers
confirm they are ready for "Network Validation" (Phase 2) and would pay for it
Phase 2: AI & Network
Integration (Months 7-12)
Connect Brain to Nervous System
Goal: Use the data to protect the Network.
• Native AI Extraction: Replace 3rd party tools with proprietary AI models if volume
justifies the margin.
• Transaction Validation: Link Active Catalog to the EDI stream. Example: "Stop this
Invoice because the Price doesn't match the Catalog PO data."
3. 90-Day Path: Validate & Launch
• Discovery & Metrics: Interview 15+ Customers to validate "Manual Entry" friction. Audit current usage data (or
implement Pendo/Mixpanel) to establish the "Time-to-Publish" baseline.
• Technical Assessment: Evaluate non-AI approach for the Phase 1 Pilot. Investigate feasibility of the Phase 2
"Network Integration" (Catalog to EDI).
• Roadmap Definition: Create Product Charter & Align with BN Strategy. Lock the year 1 roadmap and secure
leadership approval for the Phase 1 Pilot.
• Day 90: The "Ingestion" hypothesis is validated, the Pilot technology is selected, and the team is aligned on the
"Network Intelligence" vision.
4. Business Value & Success Metrics
What This Achieves:
• Neutralize competitive threat: Fix ingestion bottleneck to match Syndigo's ease-of-use
• Create unique differentiation: Transaction validation leveraging our network position
• Increase stickiness: Embed master data into EDI flow, making Business Network indispensable
How We Measure Success:
• Speed-to-Shelf: Reduce Time-to-Publish from days to hours (retention driver)
• Transaction Quality: Reduce chargebacks by X% for integrated customers (acquisition driver)
• Network Adoption: % of customers using transaction validation (stickiness indicator)
