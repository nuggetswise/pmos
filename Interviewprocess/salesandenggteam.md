Wed, 10 Dec 25

### Meeting Overview

- Product Manager interview for OpenText Active Catalog role
- Participants: Patrick (SF Bay Area Software Engineering Manager), Don Weiner (Chicago Customer Management Team Lead - North America retail)
- Patrick currently handling PM duties while wearing multiple hats (engineering manager, scrum master, product owner)

### OpenText Active Catalog Context

- 35+ year old retail data synchronization solution (started 1988)
- Most widely used catalog solution in retail industry for general merchandise and apparel
- Focus on physical shelf vs competitors like Cindigo (digital shelf focus)
- Key to land-and-expand strategy - once catalog deployed, can sell other BN services
- Serves large retailers: Loblaws, Sobeys, Nordstrom, Macy’s and their suppliers
- Don’s team manages North American retail customers and partnerships

### Mandipinder’s Background & Domain Transition

- 10+ years B2B SaaS and AI experience across multiple verticals
- Previous OpenText experience (May 2021-2023): Carbonite enterprise backup product, $15M ARR
- MBA in supply chain + Infosys experience with P&G/J&J procurement catalog optimization
- Framework for domain adaptation:
  1. Interview 30+ stakeholders in first 1-2 weeks
  2. External market research
  3. Leverage cross-domain experience (supply chain background relevant to retail)

### Product Vision & Prioritization Approach

- Three-pillar superpower identification for Active Catalog:
  1. One of largest catalogs in retail industry
  2. Business network ecosystem integration capabilities
  3. Physical shelf leadership vs competitors’ digital focus
- RISE framework for backlog prioritization (Reach × Impact × Confidence ÷ Effort)
- Data-driven approach combining qualitative (stakeholder interviews) and quantitative (usage analytics) research
- Stakeholder alignment through weekly cross-functional meetings and quarterly reviews

### Current Market Challenges & Opportunities

- Suppliers now manage 3x more SKUs than 2020 across multiple retail channels
- Launch cycles compressed to weekly cadence
- Key pain points:
  - Unstructured data (PDFs, images) slowing onboarding
  - Data contradictions and inconsistent terminology
  - Multiple channel requirements with distinct extended attributes
- Business impact: Revenue window losses, $80+ chargeback errors, competitive disadvantage
- Strategic question: Continue GS1 extended attribute approach vs AI-driven data extraction like Cindigo

### Integration & Customer Feedback Insights

- Customer requests for better integration between OpenText catalog and OneWorldSync (GMA/CPG focused)
- Potential path to expand into Target/other retailers through competitor integration
- Need to position catalog beyond just PO generation - rich extended attributes support e-commerce
- Stale pent-up demand list requires customer validation through surveys/user groups
- Recommendation: Revive customer user groups at GS1 Connect (Las Vegas, June)
- Key customer contact: Kobe Sparks (semi-retired from J.Crew) has catalog extension ideas

### Proposed Two-Phase Approach

- Phase 1 (Non-AI): Third-party PDF extraction tools, synonym pattern matching from historical data
- Decision checkpoint: Evaluate if Phase 1 solves onboarding/chargeback issues
- Phase 2 (AI Investment): Advanced validation, schema intelligence, document extraction if Phase 1 insufficient
- Philosophy: Solve 80-90% of problems without AI first, then assess need for larger investment

### Next Steps

- Document sharing: Strategic supplier onboarding acceleration analysis to be sent via HR
- HR to follow up on interview process
- Potential collaboration on customer meetings with key retailers and global brands
