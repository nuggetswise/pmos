## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Location |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Fixed session summary content bug (Phase 5) | User reported summaries pulling from projects.md instead of session data | hooks/prompt-detector.sh, hooks/session-end.sh, nexa/src/summarize.ts |
| Made hook instructions explicit about tool usage | Saying "read and update" wasn't enough - Claude needs "You MUST use Read tool... Edit tool" | hooks/prompt-detector.sh:60, hooks/session-end.sh:26 |
| Enhanced summarize.ts to gather real data | CLI should capture git changes, state.json, audit log - not rely on AI inference | nexa/src/summarize.ts |

## Open Items for Next Session

### Follow-Up Actions
- [ ] Test end-to-end in a FRESH session (start → work → goodbye → verify summary)
- [ ] The testing process consumes session_start_time - be aware when debugging

### Questions Raised
- "When will AI fill the data?" → Answered: After hook injects context, Claude must READ draft and EDIT it
- Hook instructions need to explicitly mention tool names (Read, Edit) for Claude to act
