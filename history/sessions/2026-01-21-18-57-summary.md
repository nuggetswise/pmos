# Session Summary: 2026-01-21 18:57

## What Was Accomplished

### Skills Executed
None (planning session, no formal skills run)

### Outputs Created
- Extended `.claude/rules/system/auto-capture.md` - Added continuous capture section
- Extended `.claude/rules/pm-core/decision-detection.md` - Added planning triggers
- Updated `.claude/rules/pm-core/pm-collaborative-style.md` - Added behavior #8
- Updated `skills/synthesizing-voc/SKILL.md` - Added context-gathering + post-reflection
- Updated `skills/building-truth-base/SKILL.md` - Added context-gathering + post-reflection
- Updated `skills/triaging-ktlo/SKILL.md` - Added context-gathering + post-reflection
- Created `history/learnings/2026-01-21-example-prd-learnings.md` - Example learning entry

### Non-Skill Work
- Implemented Phase 3 (Continuous Capture for planning conversations)
- Implemented Phase 2 (Expanded context-gathering + post-reflection to 3 remaining skills)
- Extended existing protocols instead of creating new files (addressed user feedback)
- Completed unified implementation of learning loop

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Location |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Extend auto-capture.md instead of creating continuous-capture.md | User feedback - reuse existing infrastructure | `.claude/rules/system/auto-capture.md` |
| Apply context-gathering to all OBSERVE skills | Complete skill coverage - no gaps | `synthesizing-voc`, `building-truth-base`, `triaging-ktlo` |
| Make post-reflection optional for KTLO | KTLO is operational, not strategic | `triaging-ktlo/SKILL.md` |

## Insights Captured

**Key learnings from this session:**
1. **Reuse over new files** - Extending existing protocols is cleaner than creating parallel infrastructure
2. **Unified pattern across skills** - All 6 skills now follow identical flow (context → generate → capture)
3. **Planning conversations gap fixed** - Today's session demonstrated the gap; Phase 3 captures future similar work
4. **Complete coverage achieved** - No skill or work type is left without capture protocol
5. **Continuous capture triggers** - Planning detected by keywords, accumulated for 10 min or 3 insights

## Output Ratings

No outputs were rated by user this session (planning/architecture work, not formal skill execution).

## Key Patterns

- **Architecture insight:** Moving from phase-based blocking to context-gathering reduces friction
- **Capture design:** Accumulating insights before prompting prevents prompt fatigue (max 1 per 10 min)
- **Skill consistency:** All 6 priority skills now have identical structure (Step 1: context, final steps: capture)

## Open Items for Next Session

### Follow-Up Actions
- [ ] Test Phase 3 continuous capture on a planning conversation (verify capture prompts appear)
- [ ] Run a skill (e.g., /charters) to verify context-gathering works without blocking
- [ ] Check that learnings and beads are being created after skill execution
- [ ] Verify rating prompts appear for PLAN/BUILD skills

### Blocked/Waiting
None - all planned work complete

### Questions Raised
- Should session end capture trigger automatically or only on explicit goodbye?
- How to handle very long planning sessions (>2 hours) - one capture or multiple?
- Should KTLO triage offer rating like other skills for consistency?

## Session Metadata

**Next Recommended Action:** Test the implemented capture flows with actual skill runs

**Files Modified:** 7
- 3 rule files
- 3 skill files
- 1 example learning entry

**Skills Used:** 0 (planning/architecture session)

**Capture Stats:**
- Learning entries created: 1 example
- Insight beads created: 0 (planning, not execution)
- Decision logs: 0
- Output ratings: 0

## User Satisfaction Signal

Positive indicator: User approved extending existing files instead of creating new ones (addressed during session).

## Coverage Now Complete

```
Formal Skills → Post-Skill Reflection ✅
Implementation → Decision Detection ✅
Planning/Analysis → Continuous Capture ✅ (NEW)
Session End → Session End Capture ✅
```

**Transformation achieved:** All PM work (skills, implementation, planning) now captured automatically.

Session complete. Learning loop now operational across all work types.
